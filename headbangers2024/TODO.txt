Notes

TODO:
verify time works/update testing approach
have alpha reference schedule from index
Make alpha more functional - add going and not going and "more info"?
extra band info somewhere
add personal Notes
filter/search for bands
Going to an already past event doesn't go to the right spot.
Current Time on left shows 0 for midnight
I think storage has messed up or something.  The key got messed up with the venue name as object change?

in progress:
mess with colors
tab picture up top

Done:
venues need to be objects
band genres
venue click more venue info
fix venue info code
the way background color is being used right now is a travesty

Needs every time:
update button day/dates so they make sense
cache name unique
verify "current time" works
venues may change up top
