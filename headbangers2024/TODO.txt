Notes

TODO:
animations
back button should close overlay

iphone:
- some text might be too long, like with 2 genres and stuff

in progress:

Done:
Current Time on left shows 0 for midnight
venues need to be objects
band genres
venue click more venue info
fix venue info code
the way background color is being used right now is a travesty
verify time works/update testing approach
got common.js
move band info to file
tap an event, close it, tap it again, saw a bunch more buttons show up beneath it
I think storage has messed up or something.  The key got messed up with the venue name as object change?
mess with colors
tab picture up top
clicking "now" isn't scrolling from a different day to the right spot
conflicts on overlay
changing the status of an event in the overlay changes some of the buttons color
refresh is closing the overlay
hidden overlay weird behavior
hidden overlay style
pick style for venue buttons
add personal Notes
extra band info somewhere
filter/search for bands
it looks like there's "placeholder text" instead of what I've been doing on overlay text boxes
 - placeholder="Search..."
check TODOs in code
offline service worker
dedicated scroll bar for extra text / make this work better, I think it doesn't scroll when it's in focus, it's weird.
clicking an event, then clicking another brings up the other overlay
note from last year: Going to an already past event doesn't go to the right spot.  Didn't see this happen...
check gtag
- make a line that moves down as the day progresses
scroll location independent per day?
overlay for venue click
- top left button text
- overlay text colors are blue iphone
hightlight the day that is currently happening button on bottom
flash the event with the updated going status
flash event clicked from schedule on overview
keeps flashing during overlay interaction
no results should say no results in search
better area between search input and results
make things in overlay start at bottom - when there's a small amount of info it's at top and it's covered up top.
figure out extra scroll length on schedule - it was drawing current time on each day, which was sometimes way off
an interval refresh scrolls to 0 for whatever day we're on

alpha: got removed
when going from alpha to schedule, set the value needed in the localStorage
flat list
sort by date
filter past events
show more info
Make alpha more functional - add going and not going and "more info"?

Needs every time:
update button day/dates
common.js has most data now
cache name unique
verify "current time" works
venues  up top
