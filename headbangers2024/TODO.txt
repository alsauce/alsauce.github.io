Notes

TODO:
tap an event, close it, tap it again, saw a bunch more buttons show up beneath it.
have alpha reference schedule from index
Make alpha more functional - add going and not going and "more info"?
extra band info somewhere
add personal Notes
filter/search for bands
Going to an already past event doesn't go to the right spot.
I think storage has messed up or something.  The key got messed up with the venue name as object change?
pick style for venue buttons
move band info to file

in progress:
mess with colors
tab picture up top

Done:
Current Time on left shows 0 for midnight
venues need to be objects
band genres
venue click more venue info
fix venue info code
the way background color is being used right now is a travesty
verify time works/update testing approach
got common.js

Needs every time:
update button day/dates so they make sense
cache name unique
verify "current time" works
venues may change up top
