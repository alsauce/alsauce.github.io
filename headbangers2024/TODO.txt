Notes

TODO:
have alpha reference schedule from index
Make alpha more functional - add going and not going and "more info"?
extra band info somewhere
filter/search for bands
Going to an already past event doesn't go to the right spot.
clicking an event, then clicking another brings up the other overlay
check TODOs in code
iphone:
- top left button text
- some text might be too long, like with 2 genres and stuff
- overlay text colors are blue??

in progress:

Done:
Current Time on left shows 0 for midnight
venues need to be objects
band genres
venue click more venue info
fix venue info code
the way background color is being used right now is a travesty
verify time works/update testing approach
got common.js
move band info to file
tap an event, close it, tap it again, saw a bunch more buttons show up beneath it
I think storage has messed up or something.  The key got messed up with the venue name as object change?
mess with colors
tab picture up top
clicking "now" isn't scrolling from a different day to the right spot
conflicts on overlay
changing the status of an event in the overlay changes some of the buttons color
refresh is closing the overlay
hidden overlay weird behavior
hidden overlay style
pick style for venue buttons
add personal Notes

Needs every time:
update button day/dates
common.js has most data now
cache name unique
verify "current time" works
venues  up top
